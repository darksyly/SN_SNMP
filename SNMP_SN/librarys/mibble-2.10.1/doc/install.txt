MIBBLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Requirements
------------

  The following requirements must be met in order to use Mibble:

    o Java runtime compatible with Java 7.


Installation
------------

  All required JAR files are provided in the lib subdirectory:

    o mibble-parser-2.10.1.jar
      The parser library and app code

    o mibble-mibs-2.10.1.jar
      The bundled IANA and IETF MIBs

    o snmp6_1.jar
      The Westhawk SNMP stack (only used by MibbleBrowser)


Running
-------

  Mibble is a library, but provides a number of small apps:

    o MibbleBrowser.jar
      Contains the MIB browser app and dependencies rolled into a 
      single JAR file. Double-click to launch.

    o bin/MibbleBrowser.bat (or .sh)
      An alternative start script for the MIB browser app, using the 
      JAR files from the lib subdirectory.

    o bin/MibblePrinter.bat (or .sh)
      Formats (or pretty-prints) one or more MIB files.

    o bin/MibbleValidator.bat (or .sh)
      Validates the syntax of one or more MIB files.

  The shell scripts finds the required JAR files automatically via 
  the lib subdirectory and adds them to the CLASSPATH.
