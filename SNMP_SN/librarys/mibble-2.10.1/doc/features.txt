MIBBLE FEATURES
===============

Highlights & Features
---------------------

  This is a summary of the features currently present in Mibble.

    o Full support for both SMIv1 and SMIv2
      The library contains full support for both SNMP SMI versions.

    o Bundled IANA and IETF MIB files
      All the standard IANA and IETF MIB files are bundled in a 
      separate JAR file for simple MIB imports. Some syntax 
      corrections have been made to enable proper parsing.

    o Proper import & symbol handling
      Each referenced module is imported either from the bundled MIB 
      files or from an externally supplied source (filesystem or 
      URL). Symbols can also be prefixed with their module names to 
      avoid possible naming conflicts.

    o Access to all MIB information, text and comments
      All the type and value information from the MIB files are 
      available to an application through public methods in the 
      library object model. Also available is the full MIB text and 
      all comments connected to each symbol.

    o Detailed and precise error messages
      Messages generated when an error is found always describe the 
      problem with all required details. Error messages also contains 
      a short excerpt from the MIB file.

    o Complete source code available
      The source code for the complete library is freely available 
      under either the GNU GPL or a commercial license. This makes it 
      easy to check details in the implementation or to make small 
      adjustments.

    o Commercial license available for proprietary software
      The GNU GPL licence does not allow distribution of products 
      based on Mibble unless they are licensed under the GNU GPL 
      themselves. A commercial license containing the full source 
      code for Mibble is therefore available for sale.
