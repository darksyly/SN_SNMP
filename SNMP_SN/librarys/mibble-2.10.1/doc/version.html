    <h2>Version 2.10.1 (2017-02-20):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Added AES encryption to MibbleBrowser</b><br/>
        The MibbleBrowser application now supports AES encryption of
        messages. Thanks to Richard Thompson for suggesting this.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/24">Issue #24</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed bundled SNMP API to Westhawk SNMP 6.1</b><br/>
        The bundled Westhawk SNMP library has been updated to version
        6.1 to enable AES privacy. This library is only used by the example
        MibbleBrowser application and isn't required for MIB parsing.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed NPE when imported MIB not found</b><br/>
        The <code>MibImport</code> class unfortunately threw a
        <code>NullPointerException</code> when an imported MIB wasn't found.
        Thanks to Yonghao Yu for fixing and reporting this.

    <h2>Version 2.10 (2017-01-26):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Added multiple UI improvements to MibbleBrowser</b><br/>
        The MibbleBrowser application has been improved by adding a set
        of patches and suggestions made by Dartware LLC. It now reloads the
        set of open MIB files more reliably and allows simple loading of the
        built-in IETF and IANA MIBs. Many thanks to Richard E. Brown and
        Dartware LLC for these improvements
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added MIB import tree printout to MibblePrinter</b><br/>
        A new <code>--mibtree</code> option has been added to the
        MibblePrinter application to simplify viewing of all the imported
        MIBs (dependency tree).
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added methods for input MIB and symbol text</b><br/>
        The <code>Mib.getText()</code> and <code>MibSymbol.getText()</code>
        methods have been added to retrieve the input (unparsed) MIB file
        text. Thanks to Herbie Porter for suggesting this.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/18">Issue #18</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added OID search methods to MibLoader &amp; other classes</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code>, <code>MibValueSymbol</code> and
        <code>ObjectIdentifierValue</code> classes have been improved with
        new <code>getOid()</code>, <code>find()</code> and other methods to
        simplify search and access to the loaded OID tree.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/11">Issue #11</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added new access methods to MibLoader class</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class has been improved with new
        <code>getMibs()</code> methods for accessing a maps of loaded MIB
        files (optionally filtered). Thanks to Anshul Gupta for
        suggesting this. <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/9">Issue #9</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added MibLocator &amp; MibSource classes</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLocator</code> and <code>MibSource</code> classes
        have been added to enable easy search of MIB modules in a directory
        or on a resource path. Variants of these classes have previously
        been used internally by the <code>MibLoader</code>.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added MibTree &amp; MibTreeNode classes</b><br/>
        The <code>MibTree</code> and <code>MibTreeNode</code> classes
        have been added to provide a simple JTree implementation of a MIB
        tree (used in MibbleBrowser).
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added SMIv1 and SMIv2 incompatibility warning</b><br/>
        Warnings are now issued when importing SMIv1 symbols into a
        SMIv2 context (or vice versa). A number of bundled IETF MIBs have
        also been corrected to avoid triggering this warning.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/4">Issue #4</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added warning for duplicate definitions of symbols</b><br/>
        A warning is now issued when two or more MIB symbols have the
        same value or when an OID is redefined across MIBs. The bundled
        <code>ISDN-MIB</code> has also been corrected to avoid triggering
        this warning. Thanks to Aleksandar Pesic for finding this issue.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/22">Issue #22</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed to Java 7 &amp; Generics</b><br/>
        The whole library has been updated to Java 7, with added Java
        Generics for all methods returning lists or collections. This change
        should be fully backwards-compatible, but now requires a Java 7
        environment to run. <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/10">Issue #10</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed missing import errors to warnings</b><br/>
        Failure to locate an imported MIB or symbol is now a warning
        instead of an error. This makes it possible to load some additional
        MIBs, as the missing symbols may be found in other MIBs imported or
        in the default SMI MIB. Errors will still be issued if the symbol
        is used (and couldn't be located). <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/2">Issue #2</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed compareTo in ObjectIdentifierValue</b><br/>
        The <code>ObjectIdentifierValue</code> class didn't use proper
        numerical comparison of the numerical parts. This caused some
        two-digit OID parts to appear previous to some single-digit ones.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/13">Issue #13</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed MibLoader to allow multi-instance usage</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class improperly used a global ASN.1
        parser, instead of an instance-specific one. This made it impossible
        to use multiple instances of MibLoader to provide parallelism.
        <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/21">Issue #21</a>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Version 2.9.4 (2016-09-27):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Clarified source code licensing for commercial use</b><br/>
        Updated to Grammatica to version 1.6 (BSD licensed) and
        simplified source code headers and similar for clarity. The
        commercially licensed package no longer contains any references
        to GNU GPL.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Updated bundled IANA and IETF MIB files</b><br/>
        The IANA and IETF MIB files bundled with Mibble have been
        updated to match those available in the <code>libsmi</code> project
        source tree (as of 2016-09-27).
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Version 2.9.3 (2011-12-08):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Fixed NPE issue for empty directories</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class didn't properly handle empty
        or invalid directories. This caused an NPE when attempting to load
        MIB files in some cases. <a href="https://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/1">Issue #1</a>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Version 2.9.2 (2009-04-11):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Changed missing SMI import from error to warning</b><br/>
        Some MIB files lacks a proper SMI MIB import, previously causing
        a parse error due to unresolved symbols. This has now been fixed by
        silently importing RFC1155-SMI when no other SNMP SMI module has been
        imported, causing each of these errors to be reported as a warning
        instead. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=7113">Bug #7113</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed NPE issue when checking for null directories</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class didn't properly handle null
        directories in the <code>hasDir</code> method. This caused an NPE
        when attempting to load MIB files from the current directory without
        using a directory prefix on the file name. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=26146">Bug #26146</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed omitted character in extract from error MIBs</b><br/>
        The first character in each MIB line extracted and printed in
        error messages was previously omitted, causing the error location to
        be off by one character. This error was introduced when correcting
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=16252">Bug #16252</a> in version 2.7. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=26150">Bug #26150</a>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Version 2.9.1 (2009-04-04):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Fixed issue with input streams not closed on error</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class didn't properly close the
        input file streams if a parse exception was encountered. Thanks to
        Masanori Sekido for reporting this. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=26082">Bug #26082</a>

    </ul>


    <h2>Version 2.9 (2009-03-19):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Added complete comment extraction and printing</b><br/>
        The comments from all MIB constructs are now extracted and
        stored in the respective objects. No comments are ever lost, but
        may be assigned to a parent object in the parsed data structure.
        The <code>MibWriter</code> pretty-printer has also been extended
        to print all available comments. Thanks to Cisco for requesting
        and financing this work. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=18844">Bug #18844</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added new convenience methods in MibLoader class</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class has been improved with a
        number of new convenience methods to enable improved access to
        the MIB search path and easier unloading of all MIBs (freeing
        the memory used).
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Improved parsing speed significantly</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class is now much faster when
        parsing MIB files, mostly due to speedups in Grammatica 1.5 but
        also thanks to a number of speed optimizations in Mibble
        proper. Make sure to reuse the same <code>MibLoader</code>
        instance when parsing multiple MIB files for optimum effect of
        these improvements.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Improved the Mibble Browser user interface</b><br/>
        The Mibble Browser test application has been improved in
        various ways to make it easier to work with. It is now also
        packaged into a separate jar file for easy startup by double-click
        on most platforms. Thanks to Richard E. Brown for a long list of
        suggested UI improvements.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed some bundled IANA and IETF MIB files</b><br/>
        A number of IANA and IETF MIB files bundled with Mibble have
        been added or updated to match those distributed in
        <code>libsmi</code> 0.4.8 (2008-04-18). Thanks to Elyes
        Lehtihet for the reminder. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=19905">Bug #19905</a> &amp;

      <li>
        <b>Changed bundled SNMP API to Westhawk SNMP 6.0</b><br/>
        The MibbleBrowser SNMP support has been updated to use the
        newer version 6.0 of the Westhawk SNMP stack. This fixes a few
        issue with SNMP context ID. Thanks to Vincent Lane for reporting
        this. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=24385">Bug #24385</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed startup scripts for better auto-detection</b><br/>
        The various shell startup scripts for Linux, Mac and Windows
        have been updated to have better auto-detection of the location
        of Java and the application itself. Thanks to Richard E. Brown for
        commenting on this.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed syntax error for inline ASN.1 comments</b><br/>
        When an inline ASN.1 comment was ended on the same line and
        followed by another construct, a syntax error would result. The
        ASN.1 parser in Mibble has now been fixed to handled inline comments
        properly. Thanks to Karl Weber for reporting this.

      <li>
        <b>Fixed NPE when parsing unresolved referenced types</b><br/>
        When a textual convention or similar contained an unresolved
        type reference, a NullPointerException could occur when using the
        defined type elsewhere (like in a <code>SEQUENCE</code> type). This
        has now been corrected and a new reference error is shown instead.
        Thanks to Markus Barchfeld for reporting this.

        After <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=17834">Bug #17834</a> there were still some cases where
        padding would be removed from specified hexadecimal and binary
        values in MIB files. A fix has now been implemented that takes all

        The <code>SizeConstraint.isCompatible(MibValue)</code> method
        always returned false, regardless of the value provided. This has now
        been corrected, so that the actual length of an octet string value is
        checked. Thanks to Paul Faid for reporting this.

      <li>
        <b>Added MIB loader support for loading from a single file</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader</code> class now properly supports loading
        MIB modules from a single file even if the modules have references
        to each other. Previously it was only possible to load multiple MIBs
        in a single file if the referenced MIB modules were placed at the top
        of the file. Thanks to Ted Kaczmarek for suggesting this.

      <li>
        <b>Added detection of explicitly vs implicitly loaded MIBs</b><br/>
        The <code>Mib</code> class now contains a new
        <code>isLoaded()</code> method to enable easy separation between
        explicitly and implicitly loaded MIBs. The latter are MIB modules
        that have been loaded due to an import declaration. The MibblePrinter
        application has also been updated to print all explicitly loaded
        MIBs instead of just the first MIB module in each file.

      <li>
        <b>Added numeric OID value cache for improved performance</b><br/>
        The <code>ObjectIdentifierValue</code> class now caches the
        result of the <code>toString()</code> method in order to improve
        performance. Thanks to Mohamed Ben-Hedi Sghaier for providing a fix
        for this. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=16418">Bug #16418</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added simple method for finding MIB importers</b><br/>
        The <code>Mib.getImportingMibs()</code> method has been added
        to provide a simple API for finding MIB importers. If the returned
        list is empty, the MIB is safe for unloading.

      <li>
        <b>Added easy access to the root object identifier</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader.getRootOid()</code> method has been added
        to make it easier to access the root object identifier value (i.e.
        the predefined <code>iso</code> value. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=16544">Bug #16544</a>

      <li>
        <b>Changed toString() to print enumeration names</b><br/>
        The <code>BitSetType</code> and <code>IntegerType</code> classes
        have been modified to print both enumeration names and values in the
        <code>toString()</code> method. Both the MibbleBrowser and
        MibblePrinter applications are affected by this, making it easier to
        interpret SNMP results returned. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=16420">Bug #16420</a>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed issue with MIB unloading not removing references</b><br/>
        The <code>MibLoader.unload()</code> method didn't properly
        remove all references to the MIB as the object identifier tree
        remained linked. This has now been corrected so that an unloaded
        MIB will be completely removed and eligible for garbage collection.

        When loading MIB files with invalid line termination sequences
        the <code>MibLoaderLog</code> couldn't properly locate and load the
        context line for any errors. This has been fixed so that only
        linefeed (LF, 0x0A) is counted in line numbers when reading context
        lines. Thanks to Ted Kaczmarek for reporting this.

        When loading MIB files with some unsupported ASCII control
        characters, the parser failed with a parse exception. The parser has
        now been modified to ignore a number of common control codes in ASCII,
        such as form-feed, vertical tab, substitute and others. Thanks to

      <li>
        <b>Added a MIB pretty printer</b><br/>
        A SMIv2 pretty printer has been added to Mibble. It can
        be accessed either with the <code>MibblePrinter</code>
        utility application, or directly with the new
        <code>MibWriter</code> class. Thanks to Cisco for financing this

        <b>Added new MibValueSymbol convenience methods</b><br/>
        The <code>MibValueSymbol</code> class in the Mibble API
        has been improved by the addition of new methods for
        retrieving child symbols. This will facilitate some accesses
        that could previously be a bit cumbersome to write.

        <b>Added MIB import information retrieval</b><br/>
        The <code>Mib</code> class now contains a method
        <code>getAllImports()</code> that allows retrieval of the
        import declarations for a MIB. The class
        <code>MibImport</code> has also been added to the public API.

        <b>Added module and symbol comment retrieval</b><br/>
        The <code>Mib</code> and <code>MibSymbol</code> classes
        in the Mibble API have been improved by allowing the
        retrieval of MIB file comments. This will enable full access

      <li>
        <b>Added macro symbol retrieval</b><br/>
        The <code>MibMacroSymbol</code> class has been added to

        <b>Added SnmpCompliance type separation API</b><br/>
        The <code>SnmpCompliance</code> class didn't allow an
        application to distinguish between GROUP and OBJECT
        compliances easily. A new method <code>isGroup()</code> has
        been added to the API so that this is now possible.

      <li>
        <b>Added SMI version number retrieval</b><br/>
        The <code>Mib</code> class now has a new method
        <code>getSmiVersion</code> that returns the SMI version that
        was used for defining the MIB. This makes it easier to
        perform different validations for different MIB:s.

        <b>Added hashCode() and compareTo() implementations</b><br/>
        The <code>hashCode()</code> method has been added to
        all classes implementing <code>equals()</code>. Also, the
        <code>MibValue</code> class is now <code>Comparable</code>

      <li>
        <b>Changed to support IMPLIED in index lists</b><br/>
        A new class <code>SnmpIndex</code> has been added to
        encapsulate an index type or value. The method
        <code>SnmpObjectType.getIndex()</code> has been modified to
        return a list of these new index objects, which will break

      <li>
        <b>Changed several SNMP text returning methods</b><br/>
        The <code>getDescription()</code> and similar methods
        in several SNMP type classes have been modified to remove a
        cleaner version of the text (with indentation removed). This
        was introduced in 2.5 for one field, but has now been
        expanded to more fields. Use the corresponding
        <code>getUnformattedXXX()</code> methods for the original
        behaviour. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=14728">Bug #14728</a>

        The <code>getAllSymbols()</code> method in the
        <code>BitSetType</code> and <code>IntegerType</code> classes
        has been modified to return the symbol list in the same order
        as the symbols appears in the MIB file. The internal list
        representation was changed to <code>LinkedHashMap</code>,
        so JDK 1.4 is now required. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=13221">Bug #13221</a>

      <li>
        <b>Changed OID validation for mismatched names</b><br/>
        When two OID:s used different names for the same
        component, this was previously considered a MIB loading error.
        The error message for this has been clarified and it is now
        just a warning instead of an error. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=13309">Bug #13309</a>

        <b>Changed binary and hexadecimal value classes</b><br/>
        Two new <code>MibValue</code> classes have been
        introduced to store binary and hexadecimal numbers. Both
        inherit the old <code>NumberValue</code> class, but modify
        the implementation of <code>toString()</code> to print the
        value in the correct ASN.1 representation. This might break
        old code, but the old behaviour is available by using
        <code>value.toObject().toString()</code> instead. Thanks to

        <b>Fixed NullPointerException on some invalid OID:s</b><br/>
        When two OID:s used different names for the same
        component, a NullPointerException was thrown when defining
        value symbols using the second OID. This has been fixed so
        that type or value validation errors should no longer be able
        to cause NPE:s in later stages. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=13309">Bug #13309</a>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed parse error for hex values in enumerations</b><br/>
        When using binary or hexadecimal values as integer
        enumerated values, the parser displayed a syntax error. This
        has now been fixed, so that both binary and hexadecimal
        values are allowed. Thanks to Andreas Schönbach for reporting

      <li>
        <b>Fixed issue with MIB file not being set in loader log</b><br/>
        The MIB file was sometime set to null in the
        <code>MibLoaderLog</code> entries. This could cause
        NullPointerExceptions when attepting to print an error or
        a warning message. This has been fixed so that NPE:s will no
        longer occur in these cases and the MIB loader should now
        properly set the MIB file in all log entries.

        <b>Fixed size constraint type validity checking</b><br/>
        The <code>SizeConstraint</code> didn't accept the
        <code>StringType</code> as compatible, which has now been
        fixed. All constraints are now also checked for validity

        The file chooser dialog in the MibbleBrowser always
        started in the user home directory instead of the current
        directory. This has now been fixed and the application also
        remembers where the directory where the last MIB was loaded.

        The library now supports loading multiple MIB modules
        from a single file, as required per the ASN.1 standard. It

        The MIB files bundled with Mibble have been moved to
        a separate JAR-file. This makes it easier to replace, update

        <b>Fixed issue with OIDs not being merged properly</b><br/>
        The OID tree was previously missing child components
        (symbols) in some cases. This could occur when the same OID
        was defined in two MIB files, something commonly used to
        avoid circular imports. Now all the OIDs are properly merged
        to any depth, making sure that none are ignored. Thanks to

        Previously it was possible that some base MIBs, that
        were used in several places, got loaded several times by the
        <code>MibLoader</code>. This didn't affect the correctness of
        the results, but wasted time and memory. The MibLoader has

        bit more informative, although documentation will primarily
        be added to the website from now on. Thanks to David T.
        Perkins and Frank Fock for pointing out these shortcomings.

    <h2>Version 2.4 (2004-05-27):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Relicensed to GNU GPL</b><br/>
        Most of the source code has been relicensed to GNU GPL,
        removing the previous linking exception. As an alternative to
        using the GNU GPL license, a non-exclusive commercial license
        for Mibble can be purchased. A FAQ explaining the implications
        of this is available on the Mibble web site.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added simpler OID to symbol lookup</b><br/>
        A new method <code>getSymbolByOid</code> has been added
        to the <code>Mib</code> class to simplify the lookup of
        symbols from OIDs. This method handles table row number inside
        OIDs, that the <code>getSymbolByValue</code> method couldn't
        handle. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=9117">Bug #9117</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed MIB loader to search inside files</b><br/>
        If the <code>MibLoader</code> fails to locate a MIB file
        based on its name, it will now resort to read the first few
        lines from all files in the search path until a matching MIB
        name is found. Opening many files may be a potential
        performance bottleneck, so it is still recommended best
        practice to name MIB files according to the MIB module name.

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed some symbol import errors to warnings</b><br/>
        Missing imports for symbols where the other symbols are
        imported from the right MIB is no longer an error. A recovery
        mechanism has been added searching for an undefined symbol in
        all imported MIB files, issuing a warning instead of an error
        if the symbol was found. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=8863">Bug #8863</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed to a simpler Ant build file</b><br/>
        The <code>build.xml</code> file for Apache Ant
        distributed with Mibble has been simplified. It now also
        contains some documentation to make it easier to use.

    <h2>Version 2.3 (2004-03-10):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Added graphical MIB browser</b><br/>
        A graphical MIB browser has been added that allows for
        easy viewing of a MIB contents, while also sending SNMP
        requests for objects. Many thanks to Watsh Rajneesh and HP
        India for contributing the code. Thanks also to Charles F.
        Schatz for providing an alternate implementation.

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added shell scripts for launching utilities</b><br/>
        Shell scripts for Unix and Windows have been added
        for launching the Mibble utility programs. The original
        scripts were contributed by Watsh Rajneesh.
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=6961">Bug #6961</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added API for loading MIBs from more sources</b><br/>
        Added new <code>addResourceDir()</code> method to the
        MibLoader class, allowing usage of the Java ClassLoader for
        locating and loading MIB files. Also, new
        <code>load(URL)</code> and <code>load(Reader)</code> methods
        has been added to simplify loading MIBs from other sources.
        The MibblePrinter and MibbleValidator programs have also been
        extended to also support URLs. Thanks to Yun Freund for
        suggesting this. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=7746">Bug #7746</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added support for unloading MIBs</b><br/>
        Added new <code>unload()</code> methods to the MibLoader
        class. It is now possible to remove references to a single MIB
        without losing the references to all MIBs.
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=7616">Bug #7616</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added method for retrieving all OID children</b><br/>
        Added new <code>getAllChildren()</code> method to the
        ObjectIdentifierValue class. This makes it easier to retrieve
        all OID children at once. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=8046">Bug #8046</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Modified the API for MibLoader.load() slightly</b><br/>
        The various <code>load()</code> methods in the MibLoader
        class have had their API slightly modified. They are now
        declared to throw IOException instead of the previous
        FileNotFoundException in order to accomodate the new
        <code>load(URL)</code> and <code>load(Reader)</code> methods.
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=7746">Bug #7746</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Modified OID child ordering</b><br/>
        The ObjectIdentifierValue child ordering has been
        changed from undefined to numerical order. The new
        implementation is actually faster than the previous one, due
        to more clever object comparison than previously used.
        <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=8090">Bug #8090</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed issue with not always finding loaded MIBs</b><br/>
        Previously when loading named MIBs, the search path was
        first used to locate the MIB file. If the MIB file couldn't be
        found in the path, an exception is thrown. The MibLoader has
        now been extended to first check the loaded MIB names, thereby
        making it possible to manually load MIB files not adhering to
        the MIB file naming standard. Thanks to Zemian Deng for
        pointing this out. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=6959">Bug #6959</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Fixed problem loading MIBs from current directory</b><br/>
        When loading MIB files from the current directory with
        the MibblePrinter or MibbleValidator application, the
        directory wasn't correctly added to the MibLoader path. This
        has now been fixed, so MIB imports now works correctly even
        for file names without a directory portion.

    <h2>Version 2.2 (2003-11-03):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Added support for ASN1.1 type tags</b><br/>
        All primitive type now have default ASN.1 type tags and
        these may also be overridden by tags in the MIB files. New
        methods <code>isPrimitive()</code> and <code>getTag()</code>
        has been added to <code>MibType</code>. Thanks to Sudhir
        Khurana for pointing this out. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=5001">Bug #5001</a> &amp;

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added validation of sequence elements</b><br/>
        Sequence element names previously weren't validated
        against the containing MIB. This has now been changed so
        that sequence elements inside an OBJECT TYPE will be looked
        up in the MIB. If no symbol with that name could be found,
        a new default symbol is created. Thanks to Charles F. Schatz
        for finding and reporting this. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=5904">Bug #5904</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added access to referenced type and value symbols</b><br/>
        When resolving type and value references, the
        referenced symbol name was previously lost and only the type
        or value information was extracted. This has been fixed and
        new convenience methods <code>isReferenceTo()</code> in the
        MibType and MibValue classes have been added. Thanks to
        Charles F. Schatz for suggesting this.

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added a number of missing accessor methods</b><br/>
        Several primitive types lacked accessor methods for
        retrieving the constraints, defined values and similar. The
        MIB symbols lacked a getMib() method. These accessor methods
        have now been added. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=5007">Bug #5007</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed the logging API</b><br/>
        The logging API was simplified by removal of the log
        printing classes. The same functionality is now present
        directly in the <code>MibLoaderLog</code> class. A new method
        <code>entries()</code> allows direct retrieval of all log
        entries from the log, providing a more generic approach than
        the previous one. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=6116">Bug #6116</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Improved Javadoc API documentation</b><br/>
        The Javadoc API documentation has been generally
        improved in various places. References to appropriate RFC
        documents have been added along with initial package
        overviews. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=6155">Bug #6155</a>

      <li>
        <b>Updated to version 1.4 of Grammatica</b><br/>
        The Grammatica library distributed with Mibble has been
        updated to version 1.4 (from 1.3). The build file has been
        simplified as a result of this. <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?func=detailitem&amp;item_id=5000">Bug #5000</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Removed some previously public methods</b><br/>
        A number of internal methods were previously public
        although there was no need for them to be. This has been
        fixed by making them private or package protected. Code that
        called these methods should be modified to use the correct
        public counterparts.

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Corrected MIB symbol value search</b><br/>
        Searching for MIB symbols by value never returned any

    <h2>Version 2.0 (2003-07-19):</h2>

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Complete rewrite with API and name change</b><br/>
        The project has been renamed to Mibble, and the library
        has been completely rewritten from scratch. The API:s have
        also been replaced to correct a number of serious flaws in
        the previous design.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added complete support for SNMPv2 and SNMPv3</b><br/>
        All types and constructs in SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 are now
        supported.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added a real MIB import mechanism</b><br/>
        Symbol imports are now handled by reading and parsing
        the MIB file. Standard IANA and IETF MIB files have been
        added to the JAR library, in order to always have these
        imports available.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added full access to all type information</b><br/>
        All of the type information can now be easily accessed
        through methods in the type classes.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added syntactical and semantical error recovery</b><br/>
        The MIB parser now attempts to recover from errors in
        the MIB file. All encountered errors are available after the
        parsing is complete. This change was made available by using
        Grammatica instead of JavaCC to generate the parser.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added warnings for wrong identifier case</b><br/>
        A warning is now issued if the first character in a
        type identifier is lower-case, or if the first character in a
        value identifier is upper-case.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added HTML release notes</b><br/>
        The release notes are now generated to both text and
        HTML format from an XML representation.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Changed parser generator to Grammatica</b><br/>
        The JavaCC parser generator has been replaced with
        Grammatica. This was done as JavaCC isn't free software, and
        Grammatica was chosen as it provides a simple grammar syntax,
        a decent parsing and analysis framework, and very high
        quality error handling.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Removed the old symbol tree model</b><br/>
        The symbol tree model has been removed as it was not
        compatible with the new API:s.

        exception. See the new LICENSE.txt file for details.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Removed JavaCC requirement from Ant build file</b><br/>
        Removed the strict dependency of JavaCC from Ant build
        file (build.xml). The JavaCC parser generator will be replaced
        in a future version of the library.

    <ul class="li-fa-chevron li-margin-md">
      <li>
        <b>Updated MIB syntax to SNMPv2</b><br/>
        The MIB file parser can now handle several new macros,
        such as MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-IDENTITY, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
        OBJECT-GROUP, NOTIFICATION-GROUP, MODULE-COMPLIANCE and the
        improved OBJECT-TYPE macro (as of SNMPv2).
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Updated MIB syntax with textual conventions</b><br/>
        The MIB file parser can now handle the
        TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro type.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>API changes breaking backwards compability</b><br/>
        The MIB class was renamed to Mib and several new
        methods were added to allow easy access to the information
        in the MIB file. Some old methods were also renamed to better
        match the new methods.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Improved code style</b><br/>
        All the source code has been reindented to use four (4)
        spaces, and various minor code style improvements have been
        made in the source tree.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Improved API documentation</b><br/>
        The API documentation has been somewhat improved by
        adding package descriptions and improving the class
        comments.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added MIB example code</b><br/>
        An example class has been added to demonstrate how the
        library can be used.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Added initial test cases</b><br/>
        Some initial test cases have been added, making
        regression testing easier. Much work is still missing on the
        test cases, though.
