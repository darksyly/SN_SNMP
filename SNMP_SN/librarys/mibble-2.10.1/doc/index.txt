MIBBLE RELEASE DOCUMENTATION
============================

Introduction
------------

  Mibble is an open-source SNMP MIB (or SMI) parser library for Java. 
  It reads MIB files (in ASN.1 syntax) and provides an API to access 
  all the information, including OIDs, types, descriptions, comments 
  and the original MIB source text.

  Mibble comes bundled with a comprehensive set standard IANA and 
  IETF MIBs, command-line apps for formatting and validation, and a 
  graphical MIB browser with a simple SNMP manager.

  See the Mibble web site (https://www.mibble.org/) or the Github 
  project page (https://github.com/cederberg/mibble) for the latest 
  version or updates.
